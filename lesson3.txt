useRef hook is used to reference a value that’s not needed for rendering.
useRef returns an object with a single property:
        current - it’s set to the initialValue we have passed
When we change the current property, React does not re-render component.

prevState - holds the value of the state before setState was triggered

useForm is a custom hook for managing forms.
    -register: allows to register an input
    -handleSubmit: will receive the form data if form validation is successful
    -reset: reset the entire form state
    -formState: contains information about the entire form state (errors, isValid)
mode:{} - allows to configure the validation strategy before a user submits the form

resolver:{} - allows to use any external validation library (Yup, Zod, Joi, Vest, Ajv) (npm install @hookform/resolvers)

setValue - allows dynamically to set the value of a registered field and have the options to validate and update the form state
