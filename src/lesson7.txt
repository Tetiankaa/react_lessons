Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state.
Redux Toolkit ("RTK" for short) is official recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

configureStore - is used to create a Redux store with specified configurations
Provider - is used to make the store available to the entire React component tree by wrapping the root component

"slice" refers to a logical portion of the application's state and the corresponding set of actions and reducers that manage that part of the state
createSlice - is used to define the name of the slice, the initial state, and a set of reducer functions.
Reducers are functions that describe how the state should change in response to different actions.
Actions are created automatically based on the reducer functions.

useSelector - allows to extract data or the state from the Redux store
useDispatch -  hook gives the store's dispatch method as its result. That method is used to send actions to the Redux store, triggering state updates.
        - payload is a mechanism for passing additional data to the reducer when an action is dispatched.
