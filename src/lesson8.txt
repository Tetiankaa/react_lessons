createAsyncThunk - is a function that accepts a string that represents the type of the thunk and a function that returns a promise.
     It automatically generates three action types:
        - pending action type is dispatched when the asynchronous operation begins.
        - fulfilled action type is dispatched when the asynchronous operation is successfully completed
        - rejected action type is dispatched when the asynchronous operation encounters an error

extraReducers is useful when you need to respond to actions that are not directly related to the slice but still impact its state.

thunkAPI(second argument of the async function) - it is an object with the following properties and methods:
        - fulfillWithValue: a method that can be used to fulfill the promise with a specific value.
        - rejectWithValue: a method that can be used to reject the promise with a specific value.

addMatcher - allows to conditionally execute reducer logic based on specific criteria.
        - matcher: a function that takes an action and returns true if the action should be handled by the provided reducer
        - reducer: a function that will be executed if the matcher returns true.
