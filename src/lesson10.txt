constructor method - gets called when the class is instantiated.
super(props) - calls the constructor of the parent class

componentDidMount(): Invoked after the component is rendered to the DOM. (data fetching)
componentDidUpdate(): Invoked after the component is updated in the DOM.
componentWillUnmount(): Invoked just before a component is removed from the DOM.

useMemo - helps optimize performance by memoizing expensive calculations so that they are not re-computed on every render
 unless the dependencies of the computation have changed.

 useCallback  - helps optimize performance by preventing the recreation of functions on every render,
  especially in scenarios where functions are passed down as props to child components.
